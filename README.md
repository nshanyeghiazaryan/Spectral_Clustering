Spectral  Clustering implementation

SpectralClustering  has three main methods - fit, predict, fit_predict

You can just use fit_predict method - input parameter for it is just a database and you will get back an array of lables.
Input parameter for fit method is a database, after which you can call predict method and you don't need give any parameter to it.
Predict method works without any parameter and returns an array of lables.
